# RNA-Secondary-Structure-Prediction
This repository provides a Python-based implementation for predicting the secondary structure of RNA sequences using thermodynamic algorithms. The project reads RNA sequence data from a CSV file, computes the most likely secondary structure based on minimum free energy (MFE), and visualizes the resulting structure using HTML and CSS.
